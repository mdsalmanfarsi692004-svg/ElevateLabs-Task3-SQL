# Task 3: SQL for Data Analysis - Elevate Labs Internship

## Objective
The goal of this task is to use SQL queries to extract and analyze data from an Ecommerce database. This includes setting up the database, inserting data, and performing advanced analysis.

## Project Structure
I have split the code into two parts for better clarity:
* **1) DataBase.sql**: Contains the code for creating tables (`customers`, `products`, `orders`) and inserting dummy data.
* **2) Result.sql**: Contains the analysis queries (Joins, Aggregations, Views) required for the task.

## Files Included
* `1) DataBase.sql` - Database setup script.
* `2) DataBase Output.jpeg` - Screenshot proving successful database creation.
* `3) Result.sql` - Solution queries for the analysis tasks.
* `4) Result Output.jpeg` - Screenshot of the query results.

## Key Features Implemented
1.  **Database Design:** Created a relational schema with Foreign Keys.
2.  **Data Analysis:**
    * [cite_start]**Joins:** Retrieved customer order details[cite: 11].
    * [cite_start]**Aggregation:** Calculated total revenue and average order value[cite: 13].
    * [cite_start]**Subqueries:** Identified customers spending above average[cite: 12].
    * [cite_start]**Optimization:** Created Views and Indexes for better performance[cite: 13, 14].

## Tools Used
* MySQL
